#### Project 03- Scripting Language

For Project 3 I have decided to make a system info app on command line interface.

For this project I used `platform` and `psutil` library. I tried using `socket` but did not find correct ways to use it.

My app returns basic system infromation like:

1. Hardware Information
2. CPU Information
3. Memory Information
4. Disk Information
5. Network Information

To get the Hardware Information I used the `platform` library and for the rest I was able to incorporate the `psutil` library.

## Instructions to run the program:

1. Find the `sysinfo.py` file and open it.
2. Run the script using python.

As the script finishes running you will get the results.

Hope you enjoy the program :)
