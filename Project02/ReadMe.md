# Project 02 - Scientific calculator

## Hello,Again!

For Project 02 I have modified my Project 01 and added some scientific calculations. It is easy and straight forward. You give an input for function and then input the number(s) and get result.

To make some scientific calculations, I used Python's Math library. `import Math`

##### I got the If...Else statement idea from browsing W3School's website the link to their website is below...
